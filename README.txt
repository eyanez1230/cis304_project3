This "SmartStore" was created by Enrique Yanez for Dr. Curl's CIS 304 class at Cal Poly Pomona.

Purpose: This problem emphasizes the design and coding of an object-oriented application using a
graphical user interface. Java graphical swing classes and event handling are used to design and
implement a user friendly interface and run as an applet on a web browser.
